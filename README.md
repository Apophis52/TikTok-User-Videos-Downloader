# TikTok-User-Videos-Downloader
Download all the videos of a user, without a water mark

Run index.py and type in the username of a user, excluding the @.
This works by grabbing all the videos of a user using tiktokapipy, then uses snaptik to download the videos without the watermark.

Setup:
Install the python packages:
selenium
tiktokapipy

Create a folder named videos.py

Done!

Stupid issues will be closed.

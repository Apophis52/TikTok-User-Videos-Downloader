# TikTok-User-Videos-Downloader
Download all the videos of a user, without a water mark

Run index.py and type in the username of a user, excluding the @.

This works by grabbing all the videos of a user using tiktokapipy, then uses snaptik to download the videos without the watermark. It also uses ad block plus to block any ads that may block the file from being downloaded.

Setup:

Install the python packages:

selenium

tiktokapipy

python -m playwright install


Create a folder named videos


Done!


Stupid issues will be closed.
